### About Piezo Sensor

#### What is Piezoelectric Sensor?
- Piezoelectric sensors convert physical parameters like acceleration, strain, or pressure into an electrical charge which can be measured.

#### Working Principle:
- When a force is applied to a piezoelectric material, an electric charge is generated across the faces of the crystal.

#### Applications:
- Piezo sensors are used in intruder alarms, medical devices, key fobs, and more.

### Our Pixercise Project using Piezo:

#### Description:
- Pixercise is a device that measures hand and finger strength, working as a game for relaxation.

#### How Pixercise Works:
- In this circuit, we use five piezo sensors and five LEDs.
- Each LED and piezo sensor is connected with each other.
- An LED glows randomly in a fixed time duration, and the corresponding piezo sensor needs to be touched.
- When time is over, all LEDs glow, and the score is displayed in the serial monitor.

#### Conclusion:
- Through this project, we learned about Pixercise, Piezo sensors, and problem-solving skills in project development.
